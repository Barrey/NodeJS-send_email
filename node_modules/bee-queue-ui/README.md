# Bee-Queue-UI

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Hospo360/bee-queue-ui/badges/gpa.svg)]
(https://codeclimate.com/github/Hospo360/bee-queue-ui)

A web-based user interface for the
<a href="https://github.com/LewisJEllis/bee-queue">Bee-Queue</a> job manager.

Bee-Queue-UI is derived from a similar open source tool
<a href="https://github.com/ShaneK/Matador">Matador</a> targeted at
<a href="https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull">Bull</a> job manager.

***

**Why?**  
To create a user interface for Bee-queue.

##Getting Started

###Installing

If you're using Bee-queue already, then all you need to do is clone this repo and run

`npm install`

Or you can:

`npm install bee-queue-ui`

```js
  var app = require('bee-queue-ui/app')(options);
  app.listen(1337, function(){
    console.log('bee-queue-ui started listening on port', this.address().port);
  });

// http://localhost:1337/
```

Where options is completely optional.  If not specified, it will default to the development settings in config.
You can also pass in your own redis configuration thusly:

```js
var bee-queue-ui = require('bee-queue-ui/app')({
  redis: {
    host: your host name,
    port: your port number,
    password: optional auth password
  }
});
```

If you are including bee-queue-ui inside of another express app, declare the basepath when you mount it to the other app.

```js
var app = someExpressApp();
var matador = require('bee-queue-ui/app')(options);

app.use('/bee-queue-ui ', function(req, res, next){
  req.basepath = '/bee-queue-ui ';
  res.locals.basepath = '/bee-queue-ui ';
  next();
}, bee-queue-ui );

app.listen(9000);

// http://localhost:9000/bee-queue-ui 
```


###Running standalone from npm

You can run the app standalone with

`node index.js`  or  `npm start`

This standalone method will require you to modify the config/development.json and config/production.json files so that it has the right values for your host and port for your redis server (also any additional redis options, such as passwords).

Or you can simply

`npm install bee-queue-ui`

**What is it built on?**  
Bee-queue requires Node (obviously) and is built on Experess. Other NPM packages utilized include, but are probably not limited to:

* <a href="http://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/mranney/node_redis">Redis</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q</a>

On top of that, Bee-queue also utilizes several open-source javascript/css libraries and tools, including but not limited to:

* <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
* <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>
* <a href="http://malsup.com/jquery/block/">blockUI</a>
* <a href="http://ned.im/noty/">noty</a>
* <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>
* <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
* <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>
